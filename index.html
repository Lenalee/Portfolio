At my current role, I work with a team that develops AI systems and automation tools. My main focus is creating AI
solutions that make business processes better and more efficient. I collaborate with different departments to build
tools that help them with their specific needs. Working closely with company leaders, I make sure our AI projects align
with business goals and bring real value.

For development, I mainly use OpenAI and AWS technologies, along with tools like Sagemaker and Jupyter Notebooks, to
build working prototypes and production applications.
